Last week was a tough week. I gained a lot of weight for the first time since I started this journey.  In fact, its the first time my average wieght for the week was higher than the week before.  It was really tough on me. However, towards the end of the week I came to a bit of a realization. My doctor pulled the diuretic out of my blood pressure medication, which is a good thing, but I read that it can lead to some water weight gain for a week or two.  So hopefully, that is all it is and I can get back on track quickly.

I completed [week 2](https://hundredpushups.com/week2.html) of the 100 pushups work out, but I wouldn't call it successful. I struggled to get all the reps on the final sets without stopping.  So I'm going to repeat week 2 this week.

I'm changing up my steps goal a bit, and switching to a walk/run distance.  Partly because its the goal for the Monthly Challenge from my Apple Watch.
