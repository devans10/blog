I find it interesting how the more I have gotten into exercising the less I have become concerned about my weight.  Maybe its just a byproduct of being close to my goal, or just the interest I'm gaining in exercise.  I find it hard to walk as much as I was, because I get so much satisfaction when I complete a run.  However, right now running everyday is not an option.  My knees definitely need the rest days that I have been taking.  I have settled into running 4 days a week, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.  I'm running 2.5 miles per run, and will continue at that distance next week.  After that, I plan to go up to 5k per day.

I'm starting a new challenge to increase my strength training, the [one hundred pushups program.](https://hundredpushups.com/index.html)  I think this is a good next step. I did a 30 day challenge of 10 pushups per day, and increased that to 15/day and 2x15/day.  The beginning of this program starts off at a pretty good spot for me.

### Week 1

I'm down about 10 pounds since my last post, so while I won't say I'm completely back on track, I'm still heading the right direction.  The best news is that Friday, my doctor lowered my blood pressure medication again.  Seems like I'm on the right track to getting off that soon, too.
