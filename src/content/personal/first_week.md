I created a [goals](https://www.daveevans.us/personal/goals/) page that I plan to keep updated to track my progress. It *should* always be near the top of the "Personal Blog" section of this site.

This was a pretty successful week. I'm down just under 4 pounds, about 3.8, which is much closer to the track I was on at the beginning of my weightloss.  I never explained the "10 push up challenge" goal. Its really just what it says, do 10 push ups a day for 30 days.  I had started trying to do some push up workouts, but a lot of them had knee push ups to get going.  Those are actually a lot harder for me, because they hurt my knees a lot.  So I figured I would give this a shot, then up it to 15 daily, or add in some other exercises like squats or cruches.  My biggest thing is time right now. I want to do more, but don't have a lot of extra time.

The running was pretty good. I actually screwed up the first run on Monday.  Nike Run Club had its first speed run, which was 8 1-minute intervals.  After number 5, I accidently stopped the workout on my phone.  So I repeated that run on Wednesday.  Friday was the first long run, 35 minutes.  I don't think I have ever run that long without stopping, so that was a pretty good accomplishment.  The final run was just a 7 minute optional run, that one was the first time I ran on the road in my neighborhood.  I have mostly been running at the track, so the hills added a bit of a challenge.

This week is week 3 of the NRC Getting Started plan, continuing the daily 10 push ups, and shooting for 2 more pounds.
