      <description>This is the first part of a multipart series on how I introduced Infrastructure as Code(IaC) processes to my organization. My end goal is to implement a complete IaC pipeline from image build to deployment of infrastructure, but we are an organization that needs to go through a bit of a transformation and need to take this journey in small incremental steps. We have a very on-premises bias to our systems due to strict compliance regulations.</description>
