      <description>In my previous post, I deployed my website on a Kubernetes cluster running on DigitalOcean. However, I still would like to decrease my costs as much as possible. The original setup used a Digital Ocean LoadBalancer instance as the Ingress to the Kubernetes Pods. This works great and is very easy to setup with Terraform. However, there are a couple downsides to this setup. At this time, the Kubernetes ingress objects cannot take advantage of Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt integration with the DigitalOcean LoadBalancer instances, and the solution will end up being a bit pricey.</description>
