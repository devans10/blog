      <description>I have been writing Python code for probably close to 10 years. The crazy part about this is that I am completely self-taught in Python didn&amp;rsquo;t know any &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to do things. Basically, as a Systems Administrator, I was writing shell scripts, and as I came upon problems that required some more advanced features, I would switch to writing in Python. More specifically, as I needed to interact with both WebLogic and WebSphere, I had to write code using the Python/Jython libraries that shipped with those products.</description>
