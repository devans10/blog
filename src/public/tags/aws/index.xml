      <description>Ok, yes, I know that I can use EKS for running containers on AWS, or any number of KaaS or hosted solutions, but none of that is any fun. I know. I have an odd definition of fun.
Anyway, my goal here is to standup a Kubernetes cluster on AWS. I just passed my first AWS Certification, and I want some things to practice on. This will probably actually end up as more of a series of posts, as I want to learn CloudFormation, mess with the RDS instances, and eventually probably move this blog over to AWS.</description>
