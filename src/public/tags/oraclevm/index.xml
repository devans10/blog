      <description>Anyone that has had the pleasure of running Oracle VM 3(OVM3) has most likely struggled with of the lack of integrations with 3rd party tools and features compared to other hypervisors. For example, there are no live snapshot capabilities and there is no agentless backup solution. It seems that Oracle has not put much development into Oracle VM over the years, and with the release of Oracle VM 4, which is a fork of the upstream oVirt project, OVM3 is most likely near its End-of-Life.</description>
