      <description>The next part of this migration is something that is a LONG time coming, replacing Evernote. However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t quite a migration. I had stopped using Evernote a few years ago, when I had switched my daily driver to Linux. Most of my data that was previously in Evernote, I had exported to folders in my Dropbox, but while I kept it, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use it anymore.
Most of my note taking has reverted to just text files that reside spread across my Documents directory, and I have no good way of organizing them.</description>
