      <description>So today I found my new favorite command line tool, ncdu. This is a ncurses disk utilization tool that is great for finding what is filling up your file systems. Especially on servers that do not have a graphical interface.
If you are like me, when I get file system alerts, it was an endless string of &amp;lsquo;du -h &amp;ndash;max-depth=1&amp;rsquo; commands. I would have to re-run that command as I drilled down through the directory structure.</description>
