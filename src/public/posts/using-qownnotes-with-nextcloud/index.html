        <p>The next part of this migration is something that is a <em>LONG</em> time coming,  replacing Evernote. However, this isn&rsquo;t quite a migration.  I had stopped using Evernote a few years ago, when I had switched my daily driver to Linux.  Most of my data that was previously in Evernote, I had exported to folders in my Dropbox, but while I <em>kept</em> it, I didn&rsquo;t really use it anymore.</p>
<p>Most of my note taking has reverted to just text files that reside spread across my Documents directory, and I have no good way of organizing them.</p>
<h3 id="qownnotes">QOwnNotes</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.qownnotes.org/">QOwnNotes</a> is a nice, cross-platform note taking application that integrates with the NextCloud Notes application. It supports Markdown, which I have become a fan of the more I use GitLab/GitHub and Ghost.  It gives you the ability to tag notes, search them, has quick, customizable shortcuts, and has some scripting ability (which I haven&rsquo;t dug into yet.)</p>
<p>QOwnNotes can work without a NextCloud integration, and you can use it with just about any syncing application, Dropbox, SeaFile, Syncthing, etc. Honestly, I wish I had looked at this sooner.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<h5 id="nextcloud">NextCloud</h5>
<p>You do need a working NextCloud setup, you can see how I did mine in this <a href="https://www.daveevans.us/posts/moving-from-dropbox-to-nextcloud/">post</a>. To setup note taking integration, you first need to enable the Notes application within NextCloud.</p>
<p>Go to Apps, the the &ldquo;Office and Text&rdquo; category, and click the &lsquo;Enable&rsquo; button under the Notes app.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.daveevans.us/img/Notes_integration_1.png" alt="Notes_integration_1"></p>
<p>You should see the Notes icon with your apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.daveevans.us/img/Notes_integration_2.png" alt="Notes_integration_2"></p>
<p>Next, enable the QOwnNotes API integration within NextCloud.  Go back to Apps and select the &ldquo;Integration&rdquo; category.  Enable the QOwnNotesAPI app.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.daveevans.us/img/Notes_integration_3.png" alt="Notes_integration_3"></p>
<p>Now, you should have the Notes app and a Notes directory.  You can start creating notes now within NextCloud.</p>
<h5 id="qownnotes-1">QOwnNotes</h5>
<p>The setup of QOwnNotes is very easy, as the developer has created a snap package.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ snap search qownnotes
Name       Version  Publisher  Notes  Summary
qownnotes  18.08.9  pbek       -      Plain-text file notepad with markdown support and ownCloud / Nextcloud integration

$ snap install qownnotes
qownnotes 18.08.9 from <span style="font-style:italic">&#39;pbek&#39;</span> installed
</code></pre></div><p>Now I can launch QOwnNotes from the application launcher and get into the configuration screens.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.daveevans.us/img/Notes_integration_4.png" alt="Notes_integration_4"></p>
<p>The screen above caused me a bunch of confusion, that I admit took my <em><strong>WAY</strong></em> too long to figure out.  I assumed it was detecting my NextCloud directory, and found my Notes folder. However, my NextCloud folder is &ldquo;NextCloud&rdquo;, with a capital &lsquo;C&rsquo;, the path above has a lowercase &lsquo;c&rsquo;.  The Create folder check box is checked by default.  So when I clicked through here it created a different Notes folder.  It took me a while to figure out why my notes were not syncing to my NextCloud instance.</p>
<p>TLDR; make sure you pick the right folder.</p>
<p>Next, is a dialogue box to setup your NextCloud Server settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.daveevans.us/img/Notes_integration_5.png" alt="Notes_integration_5"></p>
<p>Click the settings button, enter your NextCloud connection info, and click the &ldquo;Connect to oC/ NC Server&rdquo;.  Back on the previous screen click &lsquo;Finish&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Out of the box, QOwnNotes looks like an app from the 90s, but you adjust the appearance.  Under Notes menu, select Settings.  I chose the Dark Mode from the Interface menu, and Material Dark color schema from the Editor Font menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.daveevans.us/img/Notes_integration_7.png" alt="Notes_integration_7"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.daveevans.us/img/Notes_integration_8.png" alt="Notes_integration_8"></p>
<p>After restarting, I change to the Full workspace, which shows me the Markdown preview.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.daveevans.us/img/Notes_integration_9.png" alt="Notes_integration_9"></p>
<p>Now I can make that one note for the commands I <em><strong>ALWAYS</strong></em> look up &ndash; openssl</p>
